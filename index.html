          Hey, I’m Cyril Millot. I come from the USA and more especially from Boston but my familuy is French. I’ve lived 12 years in Versailles before moving to the States. Currently I’m studiying at <br/> <br/> <a href="https://www.essec.edu/fr/" rel="ESSEC" target="_blank" class="btn-grey"> ESSEC</a>.  
          <br/> <br/> I love painting and playing soccer and I play piano in my free time.

        <h2>Soccer</h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate about <strong>soccer</strong>, I practiced it for <strong>12 years</strong>. I had the opportunity to play it in many competitions.

          <h2>Painting </h2>
          <p>
          I love art especially paints. When I come to France usually to visit my family I love to visit the <a href="https://www.quaibranly.fr/fr/" rel="Musée du Quai Branly" target="_blank"><strong>Musée du Quai Branly</strong></a>, in Paris.  <br> Because It is a beautiful place with incredible pieces of arts.
          Also I do paintings in my free time, it helps me destress myself.

          My favorite Artist is Picasso, I like how he expresses his feelings through indescriptible forms and colors. I like to play and analyse by myself his paintings to get to the deep bottom of his mind and expressions.          </p>
            

        <div id="The USA" class="card-white">
          <h2>The USA</h2>
          <p>
          I had the chance to grow in the <strong> USA </strong>for most of my teenage years. There I’ve met some incredible people and a totally brand new culture, because, as close as the <strong> American culture </strong> looks to the French one, it is quite <strong> different </strong>. Currently my family is still living there. I have 2 brothers and 1 dog. But since I’ve moved to Cergy I haven't seen them.
